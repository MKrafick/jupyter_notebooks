# DB Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that I create for different purposes.
These are often of my own creation but will also borrow heavily (with permission)
from other notebooks or presentations I have been exposed to. Special recognition
goes to Ember Crooks and Mark Gillis (Triton Consulting) for great source material.

**Note**: Notebooks will utilize a variables file for connection information. The variable file should be in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook. Comments in the file will provide direction
on how to use it.

**Notebooks**:
 - **General Database Check** : Overall database health, best practices, and performance analysis for a Db2 database.
