# DB Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that I create for different purposes. These are often of my own creation but will also borrow heavily (with permission) from other notebooks or presentations I have been exposed to. Special recognition goes to Ember Crooks and Mark Gillis (Triton Consulting) for great source material.

**Note**: 
Notebooks will utilize a variables file for connection information. The variable file should be in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook. Comments in the file will provide direction on how to use it.
